# Layman's Guide to Circular Area

For basic setup and simple questions, read the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/README.md#quick-start-guide) or [FAQ](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/FAQ.md#faq) instead of this guide.

This guide simplifies various concepts down to how they effectively work from the perspective of the user. 

Many parts of Circular Area work in more complex ways but are simplified to minimize confusion.

## Why you should use Circular Area

Rectangles are unnatural to the wrists and fingers. The natural full range of motion of your wrists and fingers is circular. 

Forward mappings match this natural motion by making the tablet area an ellipse. This creates a feeling of evenness when reaching for any point on the tablet area and removes strain caused by reaching for corners on a rectangular area.

Inverse mappings make the tablet area a half-face superellipse. These are useful for an entirely different reason than forward mappings. When gripping a tablet pen, it should be the most stable to move around the center of the tablet area. This stability decreases when reaching for the corners of the tablet area. Inverse mappings compensate for this by effectively increasing the tablet area when moving to the corners.

For more information on how forward and inverse mappings work, see below:

## Forward vs Inverse Mappings

### Forward Mappings:

- Forward mappings are any mappings that do not include "inverse" in their name. 

- These mappings make the tablet area an ellipse, transform its proportions based on the tablet area, then map it to the rectangular monitor area.

- Forward mappings will decrease the physical distance required to move from one corner to another while keeping the side to side distance the same.

- Forward mapping area shape examples:

### Inverse Mappings:

- Inverse mappings are any mappings that include "inverse" in their name.

- These mappings make the tablet area a half-face superellipse, transform its proportions based on the tablet area, then map it to the rectangular monitor area.

- Inverse mappings will decrease the physical distance required to move from one side to another while keeping the corner-to-corner distance the same.

## [Mappings Index](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings_index.md#mappings-index)

The [Mappings Index](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings_index.md#mappings-index) contains a list of all the mapping pages in Circular Area. Mapping pages include visualizations and formulas for each mapping and its inverse.

Below are explanations of these mappings:

<br>

## Primary Mapping Styles

These are the mappings all other mappings are based off. This applies to both forward and inverse mappings, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### [FG-Squircular Mapping:](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings/fg_squircular_mapping.md)

- When moving straight outwards from the center, the input will always stay straight.

- Movement around the center of the area will feel almost the same as a rectangular area, and more distorted towards the edges.

- Secondary mapping types allow for lots of customizability in how the distortion is handled. Different parts of areas can have more or less distortion depending on the mapping.

### [Elliptical Grid Mapping:](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings/elliptical_grid_mapping.md)

- When moving straight outwards from the center, the input will curve towards the corner-to-corner diagonals or the axes depending on whether the mapping is forward or inverse, respectively.

- Movement around the center of the area will feel almost the same as a rectangular area, and more distorted towards the edges.

- Secondary mapping types have the option to add more distortion towards the corners or distribute distortion axially. Axial distribution of the distortion stretches either the X or Y axis (Horizontal or Vertical) more than the other axis.

### [Simple Stretch:](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings/simple_stretch.md)

- Moving straight outwards from the center, the input will always stay straight.

- Moving around any part of the area and crossing any line of symmetry will make input change direction, often unexpectedly to the user. The lines of symmetry are the X and Y axis, as well as the corner-to-corner diagonals.

- Secondary mapping types distribute distortion axially in different ways. These mappings will feel very similar to the user. Axial distribution of the distortion stretches either the X or Y axis (Horizontal or Vertical) more than the other axis.

### [Lamé-based Mappings:](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings/lam%C3%A9_based_mappings.md)

Note: These mappings are not direct counterparts of each other. Lamé-based Mappings cannot be explicitly reversed.

- Forward mapping: 
    - When moving straight outwards from the center, the input will curve towards the corners to an extreme extent.
    - On small areas or low/medium LPI tablets, input will jump when crossing the axes far from the center due to the extreme distortion.
    - Movements get faster non-linearly towards the corners and sides of the area.

<div>

- Inverse mapping:
    - When moving straight outwards from the center, the input will always stay straight. But, when offset towards any corner, input will bubble outwards towards that corner.
    - On small areas or low/medium LPI tablets, input will jump when crossing the axes near the center due to the extreme distortion.
    - Movements get slower non-linearly towards the corners and sides of the area.

## Secondary Mapping Styles

These mappings are based off and will be compared to their respective primary mappings.

## Tertiary Mapping Styles

These mappings mix between primary and secondary mappings. Changing the value of `β` changes how the tertiary mapping is mixed. `β` accepts any value from 0 to 1.

Below are `β` values where tertiary mappings match primary or secondary mappings.

## Multiple Mappings

Circular area filtering is not restricted to using one mapping at a time. It is not recommended to use multiple mappings, and usually the results of applying multiple mappings are not desirable, but it is possible.

The below diagrams show the shape of the tablet area with various mappings applied up to three times.
