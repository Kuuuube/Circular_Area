Note: Sham Quartic Mapping mapping is currently excluded from Circular Area due to troubles with the implementation. Sham Quartic Mapping Inverse works as intended. Diagrams for this page will be completed when Sham Quartic Mapping is added.

Note: Inverse mapping outputs are upscaled by ≈1.4142 to fill the entire monitor area. The inverse mapping formula shown here excludes this.
