Notes: 
- Due to incompatibility with my diagram generation methods these mappings currently do not have diagrams. This page may be completed in the future.
- These mappings are not counterparts to one another. Lamé-based Mappings do not have direct inverses. These two mappings are distinctly different.

Note: Inverse mapping outputs are upscaled by ≈1.4142 to fill the entire monitor area. The inverse mapping formula shown here excludes this.
