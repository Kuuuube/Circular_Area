# FAQ

### 1. Which mapping should I use?

[FG-Squircular Mapping](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings/fg_squircular_mapping.md#fg-squircular-mapping), [FG-Squircular Mapping Inverse](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings/fg_squircular_mapping.md#fg-squircular-mapping-inverse), [Elliptical Grid Mapping](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings/elliptical_grid_mapping.md#elliptical-grid-mapping), and [Elliptical Grid Mapping Inverse](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings/elliptical_grid_mapping.md#elliptical-grid-mapping-inverse) are recommended for anyone new to Circular Area.

For more information on mappings see: [Layman's Guide to Circular Area](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/layman_s_guide_to_circular_area) and [Mappings Index](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings_index.md).

### 2. Does it really make my area circular?

Yes. Circular Area transforms your area into one of two area shapes depending on the mapping type:

For more information on mapping types see: [Forward vs Inverse Mappings](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/layman_s_guide_to_circular_area#forward-vs-inverse-mappings)

### 3. OpenTabletDriver doesn't show my area as an ellipse or half-face superellipse. Is the plugin broken?

No. Circular Area changes your tablet area without changing the GUI. Currently, OTD does not allow plugins to change GUI. If OTD makes this option available in the future, Circular Area will make use of it.

### 4. What benefits does a circular area have over a rectangular area?

See: [Why you should use circular area](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/layman_s_guide_to_circular_area#why-you-should-use-circular-area)

<br>

### 5. Circular Area has lots of distortion. Wouldn't that make it harder to use?

The distortion is by design and without this distortion, there would be no benefits to using a circular area.

It may look hard to use but it's easier than it appears. See below:

<br>

### 6. It must take a long time or a lot of practice to get used to playing like this, right?

No. As surprising as it may seem, you can get almost entirely accustomed to Circular Area in a day or two. However, it can take around a week or longer to become completely comfortable with Circular Area.

<br>

### 7. Are there any mappings that make my area a squircle or only somewhat circular?

No. Currently, there are no mappings like this.

If you would like to help on the mathematical side of adding this feature please contact me on discord: Kuuube#6878. Serious inquiries only.

<br>

### 8. Can I enable multiple mappings?

Yes and no. There will not be any errors if you enable multiple mappings. But, the results are usually undesirable.

<br>

### 9. Can I mix between two different mappings? I like different parts of two mappings is it possible to combine them?

Yes. Use tertiary mappings. See: [Tertiary Mapping Styles](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/layman_s_guide_to_circular_area#tertiary-mapping-styles)

However, some mappings cannot be mixed between because they are too far unrelated.

### 10. If I spin my pen in a circular motion will the cursor spin in a rectangular motion?

Usually, no. However, it is possible to do this with [Simple Stretch-based mappings](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Circular_Area/blob/main/wiki/mappings_index.md#simple-stretch).

<br>

### 11. Is Circular Area good for drawing or writing?

Probably not. There are always people who are outliers but it will go against years of muscle memory. Drawing or writing while correcting for distortion can be very hard. When drawing or writing it is expected for physical movements to match what is happening on the monitor. Circular Area breaks this connection.

This is not an issue in osu! because there are no set movements, osu! aim is not memorized in the same ways writing characters or drawing specific lines are, and there does not need to be a strong connection between physical movement and cursor movement.
