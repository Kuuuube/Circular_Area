Circular mapping for tablet areas.

## Quick start guide:
- Enable one of the mapping types and apply the setting

#### Tips: 
- It is recommended to start with either FG-Squircular or Elliptical Grid and branch out from there
- Enabling more than one mapping can cause issues. Instead you should use the blended or biased mappings to mix between different types.
